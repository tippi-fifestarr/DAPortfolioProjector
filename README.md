# DAPortfolioProjector
What it is.  
Create, read and send money into your portfolio projects
 by deploying this contract yourself and updating this 
  Somewhat Janky UX.  

The show off factor:
If I can create, update (how to delete from Blockchain?)
 and read from a Blockchain and mongoDb last year in 
Winter Camp World Culture & Music Production website
Link (later)

The Portfolio Project "Projector":
A five star? WebDev Portfolio Project that itself
Is a web 2.87 Portfolio Project of Portfolio projects 

Next steps: Check the recently forked 0.8.1 version from iBobb,
finish final project DAOstack

1. next build && next export

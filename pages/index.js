                    <p>Each 0x___ address on this index represent a single project within my portfolio. 
                        Each project exists as Smart Contract on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and therefore 
                        can send and recieve real ETH.  Only Tippi Fifestarr may create new projects, but all of you
                        are welcome and encouraged to check out my projects details and contribute ETH towards future
                        development!  Any user with valid wallet address (metamask recommended) can contribute to a project
                        and by contributing, you gain the ability to approve (vote!) any and all requests within that project.
                        Tippi Fifestarr must finalize the request to actually send the funds to desired address (either pay self
                        or pay others to help!)
